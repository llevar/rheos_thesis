This work is dedicated to the memory of my mother Elena Gitelson. 

I'd like to thank and acknowledge, first and foremost, my immediate family, wife Polina Litvak, and children Anastacia and Alexandra Yakneen for sticking with me through the thick and thin, and putting up with my perennial preoccupation with my research and this document.

I'd like to thank and acknowledge my mentors Jan Korbel and Michael Gertz, for helping me start, continue, and finish this project; for giving me the space to develop my ideas, yet providing the guidance necessary to stay on the right course. 

I'd like to thank and acknowledge the Faculty of Mathematics and Computer Science at Ruprecht-Karls-Universit√§t Heidelberg for giving me the privilege and opportunity to carry out my doctoral research here.

I have been inspired all my life by my parents' Elena Gitelson and Vladimir Iakhnin's dedication to research in medicine and physics, and especially by the example of my grandfather Joseph Gitelson, who today, at 90 years of age, still actively contributes to scientific research. May this work be a contribution worthy of their legacy.
